# Delete Starting Even Numbers
Write a function called delete_starting_evens() that has a parameter named lst.
The function should remove elements from the front of lst until the front of the list is not even. 
The function should then return lst.

# Odd Indices
Create a function named odd_indices() that has one parameter named lst.
The function should create a new empty list and add every element from lst that has an odd index. 
The function should then return this new list.

# Exponents
Create a function named exponents() that takes two lists as parameters named bases and powers. 
Return a new list containing every number in bases raised to every number in powers.

# Larger Sum
Create a function named larger_sum() that takes two lists of numbers as parameters named lst1 and lst2.
The function should return the list whose elements sum to the greater number.
If the sum of the elements of each list are equal, return lst1.

# Over 9000
Create a function named over_nine_thousand() that takes a list of numbers named lst as a parameter.
The function should sum the elements of the list until the sum is greater than 9000. When this happens, 
the function should return the sum. If the sum of all of the elements is never greater than 9000, 
the function should return total sum of all the elements. If the list is empty, the function should return 0.
